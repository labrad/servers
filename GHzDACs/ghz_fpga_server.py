# CHANGELOG:
#
# 2011 November 30 - Daniel Sank / Jim Wenner
#
# Run Sequence setting now only tries to get ADC demodulation ranges when
# getTimingData is True. If getTimingData is False, no data is extracted,
# so it's impossible to store the I and Q ranges.
#
# 2011 November 29 - Jim Wenner
#
# Removed adc_recalibrate from adc_bringup since this may randomize order of
# I,Q outputs.
#
# 2011 November 16 - Dan Sank/Jim Wenner
#
# Fixed documentation for dac_lvds and dac_fifo.
# Changed return type tag for dac_bringup. Now an array of clusters instead of
# a cluster of clusters.
#
# For dac and adc device objects, changed device.params to device.buildParams.
# This was done because we now have _build_ specific, and _board_ specific
# parameters stored in the registry and we need to distinguish these in the
# variable names.
#
# In other words, build specific data are in device.buildParams
# and board specific data are in device.boardParams
#
# 2011 November 10 - Jim Wenner
#
# Fixed bug where, in list_dacs and list_adcs, looked for (name,id) in devices 
# when checking board groups even though only name present by this point.
#
# 2011 November 4 - Daniel Sank
#
# The code around line 1172 which read "c[runner.dev]['ranges']=runner.ranges"
# didn't work because I had never assigned runner.ranges. This is now assigned
# near line 601.
#
# 2011 November 2 - Jim Wenner
#
# Moved bringup code into the server. This was done to help keep bringup and
# server code synchronized with each other.
#
# DAC bringup now has signed data as default. Added
# functions to return list of DACs or of ADCs.
#
# In setFIFO, removed reset of LVDS sample delay. Changed how check FIFO
# counter to ensure final value same as what thought setting to. In both
# setFIFO and setLVDS, added success/ failure checks and modified return
# parameters. Changed default FIFO counter from 3 to value in registry provided 
# for each board. Changed default setLVDS behavior from optimizing LVDS SD to
# getting SD from board-specific registry key while adding option to use
# optimal SD instead. setLVDS returns MSD, MHD even if sample delay specified.
#
# Board specific registry keys are located in ['Servers','GHz FPGAs'] and are
# of form:
# dacN=[('fifoCounter', 3), ('lvdsSD', 3), ('lvdsPhase', 180)]
#
# 2011 February 9 - Daniel Sank
# Removed almost all references to hardcoded hardware parameters, for example
# the various SRAM lengths. These values are now board specific.
# As an example of how this is implemented, we used to have something like
# this:
# def adc_filter_func(self, c, bytes, stretchLen=0, stretchAt=0):
#     assert len(bytes) <= FILTER_LEN, 'Filter function max length is %d' \
#                                       % FILTER_LEN
#     dev = self.selectedADC(c)
#     ...
# where FILTER_LEN was a global constant. We now instead have this:
# def adc_filter_func(self, c, bytes, stretchLen=0, stretchAt=0):
#     dev = self.selectedADC(c)
#     assert len(bytes) <= dev.buildParams['FILTER_LEN'], 'Filter function max\
#                          length is %d' % dev.buildParams['FILTER_LEN']
#     ...    
# so that the filter length is board specific. These board specific parameters
# are loaded by the board objects when they are created, See dac.py and adc.py
# for details on how these parameters are loaded.


# + DOCUMENTATION
#
# Communication between the computer and the FPGA boards works over ethernet.
# This server and the associated board type definition files dac.py and adc.py
# abstract away this ethernet communication. This means that you don't have
# to explicitly tell the direct ethernet server to send packets to the boards.
# Instead you call, for example, this server's Memory command and the server
# will build the appropriate packets for the board you've selected and the
# memory sequence you want to send. No packets are actually sent to the boards
# until you tell them to turn using one of the following commands:
# DAC Run SRAM      - Runs SRAM on one board without waiting for a daisychain
#                     pulse.
# ADC Run Demod     - Runs ADC demod mode on one board without waiting for a
#                     daisychain pulse.
# ADC Run Average   - Runs ADC average mode on one board without waiting for a
#                     daisychain pulse.
# Run Sequence      - Runs multiple boards synchronously using the daisychain
#                     (DACs and ADCs).
# When one of the one-off (no daisychain) commands is sent, whichever DAC
# or ADC you have selected in your context will run and return data as
# appropriate. The use of Run Sequence is slightly more complicated. See below.
#
# ++ USING RUN SEQUENCE
# The Run Sequence command is used to run multiple boards synchronously using
# daisychain pulses to trigger SRAM execution. Here are the steps to use it:
# 1. "Daisy Chain" to specify what boards will run
# 2. "Timing Order" to specify which boards' data you will collect
# 3. Set up DACS - for each DAC you want to run call Select Device and then:
#   a. SRAM or SRAM dual block
#   b. Memory
#   c. Start Delay
# 4. Set up ADCs - for each ADC you want to run call Select Device and then:
#   a. ADC Run Mode
#   b. ADC Filter Func (set this even if you aren't using demodulation mode)
#   c. ADC Demod Phase
#   d. ADC Trig Magnitude
#   e. Start Delay
# For information on the format of the data returned by Run Sequence see its
# docstring.
#
# ++ REGISTRY KEYS
# In order for the server to set up the board groups and fpga devices properly
# there are a couple of registry entries that need to be set up. Registry keys
# for this server live in ['','Servers','GHz FPGAs']
#
# boardGroups: *(ssw*(sw)), [(groupName,directEthernetServername,portNumber,
#                               [(boardName,daisychainDelay),...]),...]
# This key tells the server what boards groups should exist, what direct
# ethernet server controlls that group, which ethernet port is connected to the
# boards (via an ethernet switch) and what boards exist on each group. Board
# names should be of the form "DAC N" or "ADC N" where N is the number
# determined by the DIP switches on the board. The number after each board name
# is the number of clock cycles that board should wait after receiving a
# daisychain pulse before starting to run its SRAM.
#
# dacBuildX: *(s?), [(parameterName,value),(parameterName,value),...]
# adcBuildX: *(s?), [(parameterName,value),(parameterName,value),...]
# When FPGA board objects are created they read the registry to find hardware
# parameter values. For example, the DAC board objects need to know how long
# their SRAM memory is, and each board may have a different value depending on
# its specific FPGA chip. Details, lists of necessary parameters and example
# values for each board type are given in dac.py and adc.py
#
# dacN: *(s?), [(parameterName,value),(parameterName,value),...] Parameters
# which are specific to individual boards. This is used for the default FIFO
# counter, LVDS SD, etc. See examples in dac.py

        Set the trig table address step and initial phase for a demodulation
        channel. (ADC only)
        
        dPhi: number of trig table addresses to step through each time sample
        (2ns for first version of board).
        
        The trig lookup table address is stored in a 16 bit accumulator. The
        lookup table has 1024 addresses. The six least significant bits are
        ignored when accessing the accululator to read the lookup table. This
        gives sub-address timing resolution.
        
        The physical demodulation frequency is related to dPhi as follows:
        Since the least significant bits of the accumulator are dropped, it
        takes 2^6=64 clicks to increment the lookup table address by one.
        Therefore, if we incriment the accumulator by 1 click each time step
        then we go through
        ((1/64)*Address)*(1 cycle/1024 Address) = (2**-16)cycle.
        This happens every 2ns, so we have
        2**-16 cycle/2ns = 2**-17 GHz = 7.629 KHz
        Therefore, dPhi = desiredFrequency/7629Hz.
        
        The initial phase works the same way. We specify a sixteen bit number
        to determine the initial lookup table address, but only the six least
        significant bits are dropped. Since the trig table is 2^10 addresses
        long and once trip through the table is one cycle, you have to
        increment by 2^16 clicks to go through the table once. Therefore, the
        starting phase is determined as phi0 = phase0*(2^16) where phase0 is
        the starting phase in CYCLES!
