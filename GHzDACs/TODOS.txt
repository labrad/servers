software only:

 Testing
- write test scripts to test board group configuration changes and device autodetection
- write test scripts to test all aspects of datataking and running multiple boards (using FpgaEmulators)
- update FpgaEmulators so they will recognize when a registry command is received while a command is still executing (this indicates an error somewhere, e.g. a conflict between run mode and test mode commands) (note that this is impossible using the current single-threaded design, so would have to go multi-threaded or at least break up the execution of a sequence using an event loop so that commands can be received while still sending back results from a previous sequence.) 
- write test scripts to test for run mode/test mode conflicts, as mentioned in the last item
- Sequence length estimation needs to take into accout the fact that that readout sequences start much later than the XYZ sequences because of the start delay.

with hardware:
- update bringup scripts to be board-group aware

Difficult but would be really nice:
- update FpgaEmulators to accept all bringup commands and respond in a way that allows the bringup to complete successfully
- we've now tested bringup on actual devices, so this seems to work.  But test scripts would be nice so that we can test java port
- then, fully test interactions between bringup and run mode using scripts

finally:
- rewrite ghz_fpga_server in java.  Don't attempt this until we have a comprehensive and automatic test suite so we can maintain compatibility
