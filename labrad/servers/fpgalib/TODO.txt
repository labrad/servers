fpga server
 check invocations of dac.<method name>
 check invocations of adc.<method name>

Immediate (yeah right):

- Check SRAM start and end addresses via printout while running synchronized. Only two numbers should show up, one for each page
- Find out how long the dual block delay is by putting triggers just before and after
- Verify start and end addr are kept within specified 4 word cell
- Ask John to change start/end addr from counter to actual address match. Not sure if good idea
- Check that unwritten words within a derp are defaulted to zeros

software only:

 Testing
- write test scripts to test board group configuration changes and device autodetection
- write test scripts to test all aspects of datataking and running multiple boards (using FpgaEmulators)
- update FpgaEmulators so they will recognize when a registry command is received while a command is still executing (this indicates an error somewhere, e.g. a conflict between run mode and test mode commands) (note that this is impossible using the current single-threaded design, so would have to go multi-threaded or at least break up the execution of a sequence using an event loop so that commands can be received while still sending back results from a previous sequence.) 
- write test scripts to test for run mode/test mode conflicts, as mentioned in the last item
- Sequence length estimation needs to take into accout the fact that that readout sequences start much later than the XYZ sequences because of the start delay.

with hardware:
- update bringup scripts to be board-group aware

Difficult but would be really nice:
- update FpgaEmulators to accept all bringup commands and respond in a way that allows the bringup to complete successfully
- we've now tested bringup on actual devices, so this seems to work.  But test scripts would be nice so that we can test java port
- then, fully test interactions between bringup and run mode using scripts

finally:
- rewrite ghz_fpga_server in java.  Don't attempt this until we have a comprehensive and automatic test suite so we can maintain compatibility

Notes:
- dac regRun ALWAYS sets streaming mode on. This should only be the case if the board is actually in the timing order. However, having the streamer enabled doesn't actually mess anything up if you never run the timer clocks so there's no real need to modify this.
