software only:
- write test scripts to test board group configuration changes and device autodetection
- write test scripts to test all aspects of datataking and running multiple boards (using FpgaEmulators)
- update FpgaEmulators so they will recognize when a registry command is received while a command is still executing
  (this indicates an error somewhere, e.g. a conflict between run mode and test mode commands)
  (note that this is impossible using the current single-threaded design, so would have to go multi-threaded
   or at least break up the execution of a sequence using an event loop so that commands can be received while still
   sending back results from a previous sequence.)
- write test scripts to test for run mode/test mode conflicts, as mentioned in the last item


with hardware:
- test new version of server on existing DACs, including bringup
- update bringup scripts to be board-group aware


difficult but would be really nice:
- update FpgaEmulators to accept all bringup commands and respond in a way that allows the bringup to complete successfully
- then, fully test interactions between bringup and run mode using scripts

finally:
- rewrite ghz_fpga_server in java.  Don't attempt this until we have a comprehensive and automatic
  test suite so we can maintain compatibility
